Set up your blog with Next 13 (appDir) and Ghost CMS; combine both packages with building a static site blog.

## Getting Started
First clone the repo with the `git clone` command

### Installation
```bash
#  clone the repo
git clone  https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/nextjsghostcms.git

# go to clone folder
cd nextjsghostcms

#  install all depe

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```
### Environment Variable ( Require )
The next setup is adding an environment variable in your nextjs app. without config, and the environment app does not work.

```javascript
GHOST_URL=https://nextghost.blog
GHOST_KEY=d762c******0a299
```

Then run your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### Note
Currently, the project is not ready for typescript. That way, I disable typescript on build time in nextjs. 
```typescript

// next.config.js

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {

  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true, // ignore typescipt error on build time 
  },
  // ....
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
